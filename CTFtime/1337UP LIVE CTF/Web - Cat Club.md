**Web - Cat Club**

Summary

A .zip file with the website's source code was provided. Looking through it, we found vulnerabilities that allowed SSTI exploitation and flag retrieval.


Initial Discovery

The site has a login page and a gallery showing cat images. The username is reflected on the gallery page, which pointed to a possible SSTI:

But during registration, only alphanumeric usernames are allowed. The site uses JWTs, and with the source code, we were able to forge a custom token.

Endpoint Analysis
We found an interesting endpoint in the code:

and

Using this, we created a JWT with the HS256 algorithm and injected #{9*9} in the username field to test for SSTI:

The test worked:

Exploitation
The code showed that PugJS was used as the template engine. Using a payload from HackTricks, we went further. The page didnâ€™t show a response, so we tried running id to confirm execution:

The response was empty:

We then used curl to trigger an external request:

It worked. The command ran, and we got a response:

Once code execution was confirmed, getting the flag was easy:
